# PostmanBackendRound2
- Google authentication isn't working and I can't figure out why, I wasn't able to implement multiple images per post because time but I have ideas on potentially how to (store an array of paths instead of a single path, or assign post IDs and identify images based on those IDs). Other stuff done. <br>
- I also think I know how to do the bookmarking (new SQL column to store paths with usernames of bookmarked posts) but time.<br>
- I'm not sure if the API endpoint documentation is what it's supposed to be but I tried.<br>
- All the existing accounts were used for testing so they're wacky, please ignore.<br>
- Template taken from W3Schools and reused everywhere.<br>
- Alerts like "incorrect password" and "logout successful" shown in terminal. Other terminal outputs were for testing purposes that are now too scattered to find and remove. Code needs major cleanup. <br>
- I know this is not upto the mark but I had fun doing it. Thank you for the task and the deadline extensions. Sorry about the messy code.<br>
- localhost:8080/<br>
- I will now end this README.<br>
